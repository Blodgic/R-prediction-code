Notes from Karin- 

Seasonilty of joining - if they join in the winter are more likely to renew and if they join in the summer they are unlikely to join
^can we prove that
seasonality is a predictor for one to two years (according to Karin) because if someone renews at the end of march they will get an extra month (membership expires at the end of the month). 
Milage - at what point or miles from the arboretum were they more likely to churn - 10 miles?
